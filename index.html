            <p>Hello! My name is Eogarasi krishnan, and I'm a student pursuing a Bachelor of Information Technology (Hons) degree. I have a strong passion for technology, especially in the fields of web development, cloud computing, and network security. Throughout my academic journey, I have honed my skills in programming, problem-solving, and analytical thinking.</p>
            <p>I graduated with a Diploma in Information Technology (Cybersecurity) from Polytechnic Mersing, where I developed an interest in IT and its potential to transform industries. In addition to my studies, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and expanding my knowledge through online courses and workshops.</p>
            <p>Outside of academics, I enjoy reading, hiking, photography and traveling, which helps me maintain a balanced lifestyle and stay creative. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, both personally and professionally.</p>
